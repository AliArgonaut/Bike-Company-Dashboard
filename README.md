Using Automation and Excel Scripting to Clean and Present Complex Data

click the folder above titled Bike Company Dashboard. The xlsx file is the finished file, but the text files contain the ExcelScript code
the ExcelScript code files format the entire spreadsheet and generate multiple pivot tables at once. Pretty cool, it saved a few minutes of work at a time and can be run on multiple sheets that are laid out like this. You can imagine the gains from saving a few minutes every sheet, every day, for a year or so.
